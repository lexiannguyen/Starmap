This is homework 4 for ECS32B.

It consists of two problems.

The first is implementing the graph code from lecture but changing it
so checking/deleting operations are O(1) rather than O(N) in the
number of edges on a node.

The second is using the all-pairs shortest path traversal to pathfind
between "stars".
